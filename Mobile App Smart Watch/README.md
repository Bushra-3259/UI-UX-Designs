# ⌚ Mobile App Smart Watch
This is a UI/UX practice project I created while following a YouTube tutorial.

# 🛠 Tools Used
Figma 🎨

# ✨ Interaction
Users can explore different smartwatch screens designed for fitness tracking, time display, and health monitoring.  
Smooth transitions between screens give the feel of an interactive mobile app experience.

# ℹ️ Notes
I made a few changes in the design, so it’s not exactly the same as in the YouTube tutorial.  
Created as part of my UI/UX learning journey.  
Inspired by modern wearable tech apps.
