## 🎨 My UI/UX Design Portfolio
Welcome to my **UI/UX design portfolio repository**!  
This repo contains my practice and learning projects created in **Figma**.  
Each project has its own folder with screenshots and details.

## 🛠 Tools I Use
- **Figma**  
- Later: Photoshop, Illustrator, or any other tool.

## ✨ About This Repo
I’m currently learning **UI/UX design** step by step.  
Some projects are made from tutorials,  
and others are my own original designs.  
This repo will grow as I improve.
